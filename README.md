# Identify_Customer_Segments-with-Arvato

## Project Overview
This project includes data provided by the Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data  concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. The aim is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of the companies products for a mailout campaign. 

Approach:
- Data assessed and cleaned in order to convert it into a usable form.
- Utilization of unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters.
- Use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
